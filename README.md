# BirbList
This project was made using create-react-app. It allows the user to create a classified ad to list a bird friend for adoption.

To run, navigate to the project folder and download all dependencies by running `npm install`. Then run `npm start`.

The listing creation flow will remember what step you were at if you leave, and remember your inputs. It will display your ad upon your completing the flow. However, there is no server running, so a refresh will clear all created ads and also forget any unfinished ads.
